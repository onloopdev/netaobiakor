For those new to SaaS business, acronyms and technical terms can be confusing. This quick reference guide explains common SaaS and valuation metrics in a mathematical format for easy understanding.

> 1. Some terms come from different fields like accounting, investing, and operations, so there may be subtle differences. This guide aims for developer-friendly understanding rather than strict precision.
> 2. Terms are defined when they first appear and not repeated later.

## Cost of Capital

- **Rf** (Risk-Free Rate): The theoretical rate of return with no default risk, typically represented by long-term government bond yields (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury)
- **Rm** (Expected Market Return): The market's expected return, represented by annualized returns of market indices (e.g., S&P 500, CSI 300)
- **MRP** = Rm - Rf (MRM, Market Risk Premium, ERM): The excess return expected from investing in the market over risk-free assets
- **Beta (β)** = Cov(Ri, Rm)/Var(Rm): Measures a stock's volatility relative to the market. β>1 indicates higher sensitivity and risk than the market.
- **Re** = Rf + β × MRP (Cost of Equity): Calculated using CAPM. The rate of return shareholders expect for investing in your company and bearing risk. Since they take on β times the market risk, they expect β × MRP in returns.
- **Alpha (α)** = Ri - Re: Measures a stock's excess return relative to CAPM. α>0 indicates outperformance versus market benchmark.
- **Rd** (Cost of Debt): The company's interest expense on debt.
- **E** = P × Shares Outstanding (Market Cap, Equity Value)
  - **P** (Price): Stock price
  - **Shares Outstanding**: Total number of outstanding shares
- **D** = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents (Net Debt)
- **EV** = E + D (V, Enterprise Value, Total Market Value)
- **WACC** = (E/EV) × Re + (D/EV) × Rd × (1 - Tc) (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
  - **Tc** (Tax Rate)

## Revenue Calculations

- **OpEx** (Operating Expenses) = **R&D** (Research and Development) + **S&M** (Sales & Marketing) + **G&A** (General & Administrative) + Other operating expenses (e.g., **D&A**, Depreciation & Amortization)
- **COGS** (Cost of Goods Sold): Direct costs like raw materials, API fees, etc.
- **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue) = **MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue) × 12

```text
Sales (Revenue) ≈ ARR ≈ Revenue
  - COGS
= Gross Profit
  - OpEx + D&A
= EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)
  - D&A
= EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) / Operating Profit
  - Interest
= EBT (Earnings Before Taxes)
  × (1 - Tc)
= Net Profit / NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Taxes)
  ± Cash adjustments (changes in payment terms)
= OCF (Operating Cash Flow)
  - CapEx (Capital Expenditures)
= FCF (Free Cash Flow)
```

- **EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)
- **EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)
- **EBT** (Earnings Before Taxes)
- **Net Profit**
- **NOPAT** (Net Operating Profit After Taxes)
- **OCF** (Operating Cash Flow)
- **CapEx** (Capital Expenditures)
- **FCF** (Free Cash Flow)
- **GR YoY** (Gross Revenue Year-over-Year) = (Current - Previous) / Previous
  - Current: Current period
  - Previous: Same period last year
- **Gross Margin** = Gross Profit / Revenue
- **Net Margin** = Net Profit / Revenue
- **FCF Margin** = FCF / Revenue
- **EPS** (Earnings Per Share) = Net Profit / Shares Outstanding
- **GMV** (Gross Merchandise Volume): For e-commerce platforms

## Valuation Multiples

- **Book Value** = Net Assets = Shareholder's Equity = Owner's Equity

  - **Intangible Assets**: Patents, trademarks, customer relationships, goodwill, etc.
- **P/B** (Price-to-Book Ratio) = P / BVPS = Market Cap / Book Value
- **ROE** (Return on Equity) = Net Revenue / Book Value

  - **TTM P/E** (Trailing Twelve Months)
  - **Forward P/E** (Forward): Expected P/E
- **PEG** (Price/Earnings to Growth) = P/E / GR YoY: PEG = 1 is considered fair valuation, meaning the market pays 1x P/E for every 1% of growth
- **P/S** (Price-to-Sales Ratio) = Market Cap / Revenue
- **P/CF** (Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio) = Market Cap / OCF
- **Earnings Yield** = EPS / P = 1 / P/E
- **FCF Yield** = FCF / EV
- **Reinvestment Amount** = CapEx + ΔWorking Capital - D&A
- **Reinvestment Rate** = Reinvestment Amount / Net Profit

## Valuation Models

- **Relative Valuation**: Compare with peers using P/E, P/B, P/S, etc.
  - **Trading Comps** (Comparable Company Analysis): Compare with public market peers
  - **Deal Comps** (Transaction Comparables Analysis)
- **Absolute Valuation**
  - **DCF** (Discounted Cash Flow)
  - **LBO** (Leveraged Buyout)

We'll only introduce the DCF model:

- **r** (Discount Rate, Required Return Rate) = WACC
- **DCFi** = FCFi / (1 + r)^i: Present value of free cash flow in year i
- **Perpetual Growth Model**: EV = FCF0 × (1 + g) / (r - g)
  - **g** (Growth Rate)
  - Used to model long-term growth, where long-term growth rate g is less than WACC
- **Two-Stage DCF Model**: $\text{EV} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\text{FCF}_i}{(1 + r)^i} + \frac{\text{FCF}_N \times (1 + g)}{(r - g) \times (1 + r)^N}$
    - First N years: High growth phase, calculate and discount each year's FCF
