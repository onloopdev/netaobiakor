## 💡 Why Migrate?

The previous Hugo static site was lightweight enough, but always had some limitations in flexibility.  
For example, implementing multi-language support, structured SEO, AI auto-editing features, etc., wasn't very convenient.

Next.js allows me to freely expand like building blocks:

- Dynamic content, blog system, internationalization, multi-platform rendering - all included;
- Plus Vercel's deployment experience is excellent, and the free tier is more than sufficient for personal use.

In one sentence:

> 🚀 **More modern, more free, more intelligent.**
