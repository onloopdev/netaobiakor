## The Historical Logic: From Division to Integration

Throughout human civilization, the three elements of evaluation, design, and execution have been closely connected yet often treated separately. As times change, the role, power distribution, and social influence of evaluators have continuously evolved.

**The Craft Era: Individual Creation's Complete Loop**

In this period, creation was primarily accomplished by individuals. Craftspeople embodied the roles of designer, executor, and evaluator, relying on personal intuition, accumulated experience, and cultural traditions to determine the quality and completion of their work. The merit of a piece often depended on the creator's skill and aesthetic judgment.

**The Industrial Era: Externalized Evaluation in Division Systems**

The Industrial Revolution completely transformed individual creation patterns. Mass production required precise division of labor, separating design from execution and transferring evaluation functions to organizational and market levels. Designers focused on creative conception, workers on production execution, and evaluators became managers, reviewers, and end customers. Evaluation standards shifted from artistic sensibility to standardization and efficiency orientation.

During this period, evaluation transformed into an external regulatory mechanism, defined by management hierarchies, market demands, and institutional norms. Evaluation evolved from personal intuition to systematic rule systems, losing its original creativity and intuitive nature.

**The Digital Era: Democratized and Instantaneous Evaluation**

The advent of the internet age brought revolutionary changes to evaluation systems once again. The traditional top-down judgment model evolved into a real-time feedback mechanism where everyone could participate. Designers and executors connected closely through digital platforms, evaluation power was decentralized to user groups, and algorithmic assistance was introduced. "Likes," "comments," "ratings," and "click-through rates" became the new language of evaluation.

While evaluation power achieved decentralization, it also faced challenges of fragmentation and superficiality. It pushed creators to focus more on short-term recognition rather than deep exploration. Although evaluation achieved quantification, it inevitably became subject to algorithmic bias.

**The AI Era: Evaluation's Return to Central Position**

The rise of artificial intelligence has brought evaluation back to the core position of the creative chain. While AI systems can design and execute, they still require human evaluation feedback to continuously optimize and evolve. Evaluation signals have become key drivers of machine learning and content generation, as seen in RLHF technology, prompt engineering, and even AI conversations that depend on human evaluation feedback.

From "executor" to "designer" to "evaluator," the human role is returning to the essence of creation—defining and guiding what is truly "good."

## AI Makes Evaluation the New Productivity

In the past, humans relied on execution to demonstrate creativity; now, humans influence the world through judgment. AI blurs the boundaries between design and execution while highlighting a new center: the evaluator's decision-making power. From art to technology, from text to material, the essence of creation is shifting from "can do" to "knows what's good."

**The Past: The Great Divide Between "Understanding" and "Creation"**

In traditional education systems, reading comprehension and writing have long been considered two distinctly different abilities. Students might score high on reading comprehension tests, accurately analyzing text structure, understanding author emotions, and evaluating writing techniques, yet struggle to put pen to paper when facing essay prompts. This "can read but can't write" phenomenon is widespread.

This divide reflects a deeply rooted belief: understanding and creation are two fundamentally different abilities. Those who understand excel at analysis and evaluation but may not possess creative talent, while creators need to transcend mere understanding and master the skills of transforming ideas into works.

**The Present: AI Transforms Judgment Directly into Creativity**

AI has changed this logic. In the world of generative models, evaluation ability transforms into creativity in two ways: building evaluation systems and iterative feedback.

Take frontend development as an example. Developers can predefine evaluation criteria for UI components: "buttons should have rounded corners," "color schemes should match brand guidelines," "layouts should be responsive." AI generates code that meets these explicit evaluation standards directly. Similarly, in image generation, we can precisely guide AI's creative direction through evaluation dimensions like "oil painting style," "warm color palette," or "golden ratio composition."

Another approach is through iterative feedback. When AI generates multiple versions, humans guide optimization by judging "this layout is more reasonable" or "that color scheme is more harmonious." AI transforms human aesthetic judgment into concrete creative outcomes through this repeated evaluation and correction process. From "I'll write the code" to "I'll judge whether the code is good," evaluation is becoming the new way of creating.

**The Boundaries Between Design and Execution Are Disappearing**

If the Industrial Revolution separated "designers" from "executors," the AI revolution is bringing them back together. Human tasks shift from "completing" to "judging," with the distance between design and execution continuously compressed by models and approaching zero in the future.

Imagine a viewer who only knows how to appreciate short videos. While they can't personally shoot beautiful videos, they can accurately judge which shots are more engaging, which editing is smoother, and which storytelling is more moving. In the AI era, they only need to provide a concept: "I want a video about urban life, artistic style, with the rhythm of a Wes Anderson film." Video generation software like Sora will generate multiple versions, and they only need to select, adjust, and provide feedback—completing the entire video creation process.

The boundaries between "script" and "shooting" are becoming as blurred as those between "idea" and "result." Creators only need to evaluate: which version has more emotion, more impact. This means that future film's core positions might not be "cinematographer" but "content reviewer"—a role focused on evaluation and iteration.

This fusion isn't limited to film and television. In writing, AI can already generate articles with consistent style and logical coherence. Authors are no longer word-crafting artisans but directors defining tone, rhythm, structure, and emotional intent. What they need to master isn't grammar and rhetoric but how to judge whether text accurately conveys core ideas.

In programming, developers were once exemplars of "design-execution" integration: they had to conceive system architecture and personally write implementation code. With AI's emergence, this process is transforming: humans handle intent description, AI handles code generation and debugging. In this new system, system design can be completed directly in natural language, execution automatically transforms into code implementation, and evaluation continuously optimizes through testing and user feedback.

In music creation, traditional production workflows include composition, arrangement, recording, mixing, and mastering. AI can now simultaneously handle melody creation, sound design, and mixing. Musicians become "creators among listeners": they no longer personally play notes but evaluate timbre, rhythm, and tension during the listening process. Future "music production" is more like training model taste—the more precise the evaluation, the more moving the generation.

Looking ahead, perhaps from chip design to 3D printing manufacturing, humans only need to define goals and constraints, and AI will automatically complete the entire process from design to implementation. Whether it's optimizing circuit routing for chips or generating 3D model structures, the creative process will simplify to a "idea → generation → physical object → feedback" loop, allowing humans to focus on evaluating the balance and practicality of solutions.

**The New Paradigm: Evaluation as Production**

In traditional production systems, conception defines goals, design defines rules, execution implements rules, and evaluation checks results. In AI systems, evaluation both defines rules and drives generation.

AI continuously corrects internal models through human feedback, making evaluation the driving force of continuous production. This means that those who master evaluation power will possess new creative authority—they no longer produce works but produce the generation logic itself. When design and execution merge, the human role transcends.

## The Individual's Re-emergence: Evaluation as Power

Historically, evaluators have often symbolized power. Those who can define "good" and "bad" can determine resource flow. In industrial and organizational systems, this power was often concentrated in institutions and capital. In the AI era, this power is being redistributed—evaluation ability becomes new creativity, and individuals become new power centers.

**The Leap from "Executor" to "Decision-Maker"**

In traditional production systems, ideas belonged to the upper level (planning, design), execution was completed by the lower level (operation, implementation), and evaluation was held by institutions (editors, reviewers, markets). Individuals lacking team or capital support found it difficult to transform creativity into reality.

The Industrial Revolution redefined "labor," while the AI revolution is reshaping the meaning of "creativity." AI doesn't simply replace humans but fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and production: execution shifts to algorithmic automation, design shifts to model generation, and evaluation rises from a subsidiary position to core value.

AI's emergence breaks down traditional creative barriers. When execution is automated and design is modelized, the scarcest ability becomes "judging what's worth doing." AI allows individuals with judgment ability to no longer depend on organizational structures, enabling them to independently complete the entire process from conception and generation to improvement and release. The creative chain returns to individual hands.

**A New Era for Independent Creators**

In the past, creative barriers weren't about inspiration but execution: writing took time, film required teams, programming demanded skills. AI dissolves these execution barriers. Now, musicians can generate tracks directly from emotional descriptions, researchers can transform thoughts into papers, and entrepreneurs can turn concepts into product prototypes and brand identities.

While AI might reduce certain repetitive job positions, it simultaneously opens broader creative spaces—giving more people opportunities to become artists, entrepreneurs, and researchers, realizing self-worth.

**Redefining the Relationship Between Individual and Society**

In traditional production logic, the core was "making things"; in the new paradigm, the core shifts to "knowing what's worth doing." This transformation brings profound impacts: education shifts from skill training to judgment cultivation, organizations shift from hierarchical instruction to feedback networks, and social value shifts from labor theory to evaluation theory. Future competitive advantage lies not in execution speed but in evaluation ability and value judgment.

In industrial society, individuals were links in the production system; in the AI era, individuals become the system's control center. The human role shifts from "execution" to "evaluation," bringing a series of fundamental changes: educational focus shifts from "skills" to "judgment," organizational reliance shifts from "manpower" to "feedback," and social division gives way to "value distribution."

This is a profound transformation: AI-era creation no longer depends on division and collaboration but stems from evaluation consensus. Every individual with judgment ability may become a new production center.

**Conclusion: Humanity's Dimensional Leap**

The AI era isn't about replacing humans but pushing humanity toward higher cognitive dimensions. When execution and design are automated by models, humanity's core task is to think at a more fundamental level: What is true value? What's worth creating? What can give meaning?

These fundamental questions are precisely the evaluator's mission—and the key to human-AI symbiosis. In this new era, evaluation is power, and judgment is creation.
